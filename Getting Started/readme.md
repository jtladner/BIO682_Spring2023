# Tasks to be completed before the first class
- This document outlines several tasks that should be completed **before** our first meeting, including:
    - Installing a plain text editor
    - Ensuring you have access to a command-line interface
    - Setting up a GitHub account and cloning the course repository (**Optional, but highly recommended**)


## 1. Download a powerful plain text editor
- For this course, you will need a plain text editor with support for regular expressions. There are several different options for different operating systems, but I make some recommendations below (all are free to download)
- For Mac I suggest the **free version** of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). This free version is roughly equivalent to TextWrangler, which is used in the PCfB book. If you are downloading the program for the first time, they will provide you a trial version of the full BBEdit, but you can continue to use the editor with a limited (but still very powerful) set of functions after this period. This "limited" set of functions will likely still be sufficient for the majority of your uses.
    - You should also consider installing the bbedit command line tools. These will allow you to open text files in bbedit directly from your Terminal window. You can install these from within the BBEdit program by first selecting "BBEdit" from the menus bar at the top of your screen and then selecting "Install Command Line Tools...".
- For Windows, I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- For Linux, there are many options, but I have had a good experience with [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)

## 2. Ensure that you have access to a command-line interface
- Mac and Linux users do not need to do anything. There is a terminal application built into these operating systems, which provides a command-line interface. 
- For Windows users, there are a few different options:
    1. For Windows 10 users, I **highly recommend** that you intall the Bash Shell using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or alternatively [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).
    2. For other Windows operating systems, you have two options. Appendix 1 in the PCfB book walks through these options in more detail (though the instructions may be somewhat outdated):
        1. Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
        2. Install Linux (e.g., [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) or [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)) within a virtual machine (e.g., [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/))

## 3. GitHub
- GitHub is a web-based hosting service used primarily for open-source software development, but which can also be used to host additional content
- Much of the material for this class, including assignment instructions and files will be hosted on GitHub in addition to Bb Learn.
- The easiest way to access files for the class will be to clone a copy of the course repository onto your laptop. To do this, please follow these steps:
    1. If you don't already have one, sign up for a **free** GitHub account [here](https://github.com/)

- If you are a Mac or Windows user:
    1. Download and install the [GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). This will include signing into your GitHub account. 
    2. Sign into your GitHub account within your internet browser
    3. Open the [BIO682_Spring2023 repository](https://github.com/jtladner/BIO682_Spring2023) within your browser.
    4. Click on the green "Code" box in the upper right of the screen and then choose "Open with GitHub Desktop". At this point, you will need to choose a location on your personal computer to locally store your copy of the repository. I keep all of my GitHub repositories in a directory called "GitHub" within "Documents".
    5. To update the contents of this directory to match the online version (e.g., to download new files that have been added), simply select "PracticalComputing_Spring2022" as your "Current Repository" within the Desktop Client (upper left) and then select "Pull origin" (upper right). If there are no updates available you will not see a "Pull origin" option. Instead you will see "Fetch origin", which will look for differences between your local copy and the online repository. If you have made changes to the existing repository files or added extra files to your repository copy, you will need to [discard](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project#3-discarding-changes) or [stash](https://github.blog/2019-06-05-github-desktop-expands-to-support-stashing-and-rebasing/#stashing) those changes prior to pulling the new version.
    6. **To avoid overwriting files** that you've been editing as a part of each week's assignments, I recommend that you make working copies of the necessary assignment files outside of your GitHub directory. 

- If you are a Linux user, you will need to clone the repository from the command line:
    1. Open a terminal window and check that you have git installed by running the command:
    ```
    which git
    ```
    If git is installed, this command will return the location of the git executable. If you get an error, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git.
    
    2. Make a directory to hold your git repositories and change into this directory. For example:
    ```
    mkdir ~/GitHub
    cd ~/GitHub
    ```
    
    3.  Clone the repository from github
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jtladner/BIO682_Spring2023.git
    ```
    
    This clones the repository and all of the files contained within, as well as the git history of the repository.
    
    4. To get updates from the repository, change into the repository root directory and execute the git command 'pull':
    
    ```
    cd BIO682_Spring2023
    git pull
    ```
