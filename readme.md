# Quantitative Biology (BIO 682), Spring 2023
- This is the primary repository for course materials, and will be updated regularly. 

### Class time/location
Friday 12:45 - 3:15 pm, Biological Sciences Room 224

### Office hours
TBD
    
### Course Description
As datasets continue to increase in complexity, computational analysis is becoming a routine part of scientific research. This is a hands-on training course that teaches you how to use general computing tools to work more efficiently and effectively in the biological sciences. This course will cover a broad range of powerful and flexible tools including text file manipulation with regular expressions, interacting with a command line interface, basic shell scripting, programming in Python, and basic graphical concepts.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply computer science techniques to test biological hypotheses

2. Write custom scripts and utilize existing software packages to address questions in their research

3. Use computer science techniques to answer biological questions with real data

4. Effectively communicate their interpretation and analysis of biological data using computer science techniques

### Required Text
Haddock, S. H. D. and Dunn, C. W. (2010). Practical Computing for Biologists. [Sinauer Associates](http://practicalcomputing.org)

Assigned reading **must** be completed prior to each class. This will allow us to minimize time spent in lectures and maximize hands-on time actively using the new tools being taught. 

### Useful Links
[Appendices](http://practicalcomputing.org/files/PCfB_Appendices.pdf) from the Practical Computing for Biologists book, which summarize frequently used commands.
